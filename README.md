# Bombergirls

I played a bunch of multiplayer XBlast in college, and decided it would be a fun game to build in [quadplayâœœ](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) with my kids.

## Current status
Two-player playable prototype
- Play development snapshot <a href="https://cdwfs.github.io/bombergirls">here</a>

## Resources
- [The XBlast Center](http://freexbresse.free.fr/xblast/) is exactly the resource I hoped to find 20 years later, where somebody meticulously documented all the various bomb types and power-ups and stuff. I should grab a local mirror before the internet eats it.
