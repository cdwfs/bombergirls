# Bombergirls

I played a bunch of multiplayer XBlast in college, and decided it would be a fun game to build in [quadplayâœœ](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) with my kids.

## Current status
Two-player playable prototype

## Resources
- [The XBlast Center](http://freexbresse.free.fr/xblast/) is exactly the resource I hoped to find 20 years later, where somebody meticulously documented all the various bomb types and power-ups and stuff. I should grab a local mirror before the internet eats it.
- [BlastEd Level Editor](http://freexbresse.free.fr/xblast/bemanual/index.html) -- I'm not sure if the editor itself works anymore, but it's a good resource to help reverse-engineer the XBlast map format (not that I want to load them directly, but it would be useful to see what data XBlast stores per-map, and to see what options are exposed to map makers).
- [Super Bomberman R Online Matches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VctqKTXCl78) Just an example video of what multiplayer bomberlikes look like, for design reference/ideas.
